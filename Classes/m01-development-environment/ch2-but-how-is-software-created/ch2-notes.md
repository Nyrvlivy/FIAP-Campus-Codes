## How is Software created? | Notes
### 1.1 - Introduction

In a nutshell:

> _"Software is: **instructions** (computer programs) that when executed provide desired
**features, function,** and **performance**; **data structures** that enable the programs to
adequately manipulate information and **documentation** that describes the operation
and use of the programs."_ - Roger S. Pressman


### 1.2 - Concepts

**Software**, as already mentioned, is a set of instructions or programs that, when executed,
inform the computer a series of actions to be performed.

**Software Development** is the process of creating, designing, implementing, and maintaining
software from a set of activities of computer science, engineering, and project management.

**Software Engineering** is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach
to the development, operation, and maintenance of software with the aim of solving problems. It
encompasses a set of methods, tools, and techniques that are used to develop software.

**Software Types** are classified into two main categories:

1. **System Software:** This software is designed to operate, control, and extend the processing
capabilities of the computer itself. Examples include operating systems, disk management tools,
hardware management programs, device drivers, and utilities.
E.g.


### 1.3 - What is Financial Education?

Financial education is a lifelong process of understanding personal finance management including
aspects such as budgeting, investing, saving, and spending. Essentially, it's the **ability
to make informed decisions about financial products and services, and to be able to use them
to your advantage.**

### 1.4 - Starting to enrich your financial education

The preliminary step towards enhancing financial literacy involves evaluating whether your
income suffices to cover your outgoings. It is crucial to **catalog all income streams and
expenditures, whether fixed or variable.** This analysis aids in comprehending your financial
status and planning future budgets and investments to ensure financial security.

### 1.5 - Without objectives, any path will take you there!

**Goals and objectives are essential to guide your financial planning journey.** It's important
to set clear and achievable goals, both short and long term, to help you stay focused and
motivated to achieve them. This will help you to make better decisions and to avoid unnecessary
expenses that could compromise your financial stability.

**Big goals are achieved by small steps** so that focus is not lost in addition to not incurring
debts and unnecessary expenses. Therefore, **it's important be disciplined and patient**, after
all, during your professional career, your income will increase as your experience and knowledge
in the field evolves.

Ultimately, recognizing that our resources are finite, incomes and expenditures fluctuate, and
unexpected events can arise underscores the necessity for **flexible and dynamic financial
planning** to adapt to life's various stages.

### 1.6 - Be or look rich?

> _"Οὐ τὸ πολλὰ ἔχειν ἐστὶν πλούτος, ἀλλὰ τὸ μὴ πολλὰ χρῄζειν."_ - Epicteto
>
> _**"Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants."**_ - Epictetus (translated from Greek)

> _"Non qui parum habet, sed qui plus cupit, pauper est."_ - Seneca
>
> _"**It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor.**"_ - Seneca (translated from Latin)

All want to be rich, to have better quality of life, but few know what it is to be rich. Being
rich is not having many possessions, but having few needs. After all, **those who have few needs
have more freedom and fewer worries.** This perspective affords greater freedom and fewer
concerns, facilitating more substantial investments and reducing debt risks.

**The ideal is to spend _less than you earn_, and not spend everything you earn. After all, what
matters is not how much you earn, but how much you spend.**

### 1.7 - Unexpected events happen!

**Life is inherently unpredictable, often presenting unforeseen challenges.** Consequently,
maintaining an **emergency financial reserve** is essential to cover unexpected situations like
health issues, accidents, or job loss. This safety net should sustain you for a minimum of six
months, covering vital expenses including rent, food, and other essential expenses. That's
important for mitigating the risk of debt and resultant interest payments.

### 1.8 - Owner or slave of your money?

> _"Pecunia, ut crescit, aut dominus fit aut servus."_ - Horatius
>
> _**"Money, as it increases, becomes either the master or the slave of its owner."**_ - Horace (translated from Latin).

**Your money management approach dictates whether you become its master or slave**. Without effective
control, money will dominate you. Thus, financial planning is indispensable, striving for a
balance between security and lifestyle satisfaction.

For those interested in personal finance awareness and aiming for security with potentially higher
savings returns, exploring fixed income avenues is advisable. Options include Tesouro Direto,
Bank Deposit Certificate (CDB), Real Estate Credit Letters (LCI), Agribusiness Credit Letters
(LCA) and Fixed Income Funds. In Brazil, each of them has its particularities, investments with
returns linked to the interest rate, pre-fixed or post-fixed. When investing in some of them,
you must pay Income Tax, while others are exempt.

For those with a slightly higher risk appetite, alternatives include Real Estate Investment
Trusts, stocks, options, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies.

### 1.9 - Conclusion

In sum, **financial literacy is crucial for a well-balanced and healthy financial life.** Setting
clear goals and objectives, to have a financial reserve for emergencies, and to be aware of the
different types of investments available. **Your financial management practices will determine
whether you control your finances or they control you** Therefore, it's essential to plan
financially, always seeking a balance between safety and comfort.
