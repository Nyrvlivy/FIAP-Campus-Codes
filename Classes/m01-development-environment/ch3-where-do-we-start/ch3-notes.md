## Where do we Start?? | Notes
### 1.1 - Introduction

> _"If youâ€™re not spending at least 70% of your time working on projects, creating
 projects, or organizing your (apparently mundane) tasks into projects, you are
 sadly living in the past. Today you have to **think**, **breathe**, **act**, and
 **work** in projects."_ - Tom Peters, Fast Company, 1997-08-31.

### 1.2 - What is a project?

> _"A project is a **temporary** endeavor undertaken to create a **unique** product,
 service, or result."_ - PMI (Project Management Institute)

A project is a temporary effort aimed at creating a unique product, service, or
outcome. According to the PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge), a guide to
best practices in project management, a project can be defined as having the
following characteristics:

> 1. Limited Duration;
> 2. Must be Unique;
> 3. Progressively Elaborated;
> 4. Well-defined Purpose and Objectives;
> 5. Interdependent;
> 6. Conflict;
> 7. Sequence of Activities;

1.3 - Projects vs Operations

Operations are **continuous** and **repetitive** activities, while projects are
**temporary** and **unique**. Projects are created to deliver a specific product,
service, or result, whereas operations are created to maintain a product, service,
or result.

E.g.:

- Project: Construction of a building;
- Operation: Maintenance of the building;

The project generates a unique example, usually called a prototype, while the
operation produces a series product, like an assembly line.
